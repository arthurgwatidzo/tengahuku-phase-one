Breakeven Wording
Break-even analysis has been used by Rooster King to detemernine, the number of units that need
to be sold per production cycle per 1000 birds.
This analysis does not reflecty payback period, the time it takes to receover an investment. 
From the breakeven chart in section 4.9.1, 301  birds  per every 1000 birds will need to be sold with
an objective of covering the costs of doing business.


4.9 first daigram shows the breakeven numerical results, at the unit price of US$7 per bird.


4.7 Payback period
The payback period accounting tool has been used to establish the  length of time (measured in years and months)
required to receover the cost of the broiler chicken investment.
From the results above, the payback period, best case is 7 months if the product is sold at US$9.00 per bird.
Normal case payback period is 10 months if each bird is sold at US$7.00
Worst case scenario is a payback period of 1 year 4 months at US8.00 per bird.
==> ***Change the labels for the  payback period around


4.5 Projected Income (from November 2020 to October 2023) **Diagram needs to be amended*** some columns were left out
The calculations were done, assuming that 42,000 birds will be reared by November 2020, with a steady increase of 2250 birds per production cycle.
=>Adjust the cycle from | 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2020 |  1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021 |  1 February 2021 to 31 January 2022 |   1 February 2022 to 31 January 2023|  1 February 2022 to 31 January 2023 |   1 February 2023 to 31 January 2024
=> Then give the explanation****


Net Present Value (NPV)
=> Add to the Acronyms
is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time.
 NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.
 NPV will indicate how much value an investement or project add to Rooster King. The computed net present value in 5 years(by 2023) is US$2,559,975.00 (which is greater than US$0.00)
 which reflects that the investment would add value to Rooster King.
 
 PS: Work down the initial investment backwards to US$128,600.00
